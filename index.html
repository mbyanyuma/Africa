Welcome to my website! My name is Moses Mulisa Byanyuma. 
This website is about ancient African history in relation
 to Africa in our present day. I have chosen do this because not
 much is known about African history to the world, including 21st
 century generation Africans. The purpose of this site is to educate
 and hopefully empower the reader by presenting them information that
 spans over 6 thousand years.   </p> 
 
 <p>Some of the information that will be conveyed in the subsequent 
 pages are as follows: </p> </div>
        <div id= "list">
 <ul>
<li>African oral history and why African history is not well-known in
 the first place. In addition, the inclusion and subsequent exclusion 
 of written history regarding ancient Africa.</li>

<li>Ancient Egypt. Now before I can present detailed information on other
 regions of Africa it is imperative to start in ancient Egypt as it was 
 the most advanced region in the world during ancient times. Furthermore,
 information will be presented about Nubia (modern Sudan) and how this region
 has more pyramids than in Egypt.</li>

 <li>Present scientific evidence proves that human civilization began in Africa.
 Therefore, i will provide clarity to the reader by providing information on 
 the origin of African civilization, which began around lake Victoria and along
 the river Nile, this is important because the conditions in this region paved 
 the way for ancient Egypt and Nubia to prosper. </li>
 
 <li>Tribalization and the balkanization of big states into many smaller ones,
 this will follow up on the second page and explain further as to why Africa 
 today has a cultural unity yet is so divided among countless ethnic tribes. </li>

<li>Intermediary between ancient Africa and 21st century Africa, specifically
 on the scramble for Africa and the independence movements of the 60s.</li>

<li>Information about the current 54 nation-states in the continent, specifically
 on their current cultural and sociopolitical status. </li>

<li>Predictions on the near future of Africa.</li>
</ul>
