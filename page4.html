<h1>Origin of African Civilization</h1>
<p> 
<img src="img/finaltwolions.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="230" height="230" style="float:right">
When we speak of the Nile Valley, of course we are talking about 4,100 miles of civilization, or the beginning of the birth
 of what is today called civilization. I can go to one case of literature in particular which will identify the Africans as the 
 beginners of the civilization to which I refer. And since I am not foreign to the works of Africans in Egypt, otherwise called 
 Egyptians, I think that should be satisfactory proof. This proof is housed in the London Museum that is holding artifacts of Egypt.
 In that museum you will find a document called the Papyrus of Hunifer. At least you should find it there. It was there when Sir E. A. Wallace Budge
 used it in his translation as part of the Egyptian Book of the Dead and the Papyrus of Hunifer. Where is the beginning of the Nile? 
 The farthest point of the beginning of the Nile is in Uganda; this is the White Nile. Another point is in Ethiopia. The Blue Nile and
 White Nile meet in Khartoum; and the other side of Khartoum is the Omdurman Republic of Sudan. From there it flows from the south down north.
 And there it meets with the Atbara River in Atbara, Sudan. Then it flows completely through Sudan (Ta-Nehisi, Ta-Zeti or Ta-Seti, as it was called),
 part of that ancient empire which was one time adjacent to the nation called Meroe or Merowe. From that, into the southern part of what the Romans
 called "Nubia," and parallel on the Nile, part of which the Greeks called "Egypticus"; the English called it "Egypt" and the Jews in their mythology
 called it "Mizrain" which the current Arabs called Mizr/Mizrair. Thus it ends in the Sea of Sais, also called the Great Sea, today's Mediterranean Sea.
 When we say thus, we want to make certain that Hapi is still God of the Nile, shown as a hermaphrodite having the breasts of a woman and the penis of a man.
 God Hapi is always shown tying two symbols of the "Two Lands," Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt, during Dynastic Periods, or from the beginning of the Dynastic
 Periods. The lotus flower is the symbol of the south, and the papyrus plant, the symbol of the north.

   But we need to go back beyond Egypt. I used "Egypt" as a starting point, in that of all the ancient civilizations in the world, Egypt has more ancient 
   documents and other artifacts than any other civilization one could speak of. So when you hear people talking about "Sumer" and "Babylon," and all those
   other places, theoretically, they can't show you the artifacts. So I have the proof and you have the belief. If you want to see it you can go to the Croydon
   National Museum in Nairobi, Kenya; there, you'll see the Bones Zinjanthropus Boisei. If you want to see the remains of "Lucy," you can go to the national
   Museum associated with the University of Addis Ababa. Of course, there are a host of other human fossils that existed thousands of years ago all over Africa;
   but you can't find one "Adam" or one "Eve" in any part of Asia. But we have to go beyond that. We can look at the artifacts before writing came into being.
   We will then be in archaeological finds along the Nile. Also you would find that there were two groups of Africans; one called "Hutu," and one called "Twa."
   The Twa and Hutu take us back into at least 400,000 B.C.E. (Before the Common "Christian" Era) in terms of artifacts. The most ancient of these artifacts, 
   one of the most important in Egypt, is called the "Ankh," which the Christians adopted and called the "Crux Ansata" or "Ansata Cross." The Ankh was there 
   amongst these people, equally the "Crook" and "Flail." All of these symbols came down to us from the Twa and Hutu. You know the Twa by British anthropologists
   who called them "pygmies." There is no such thing in Africa known as a "pygmy," much less "pygmies." But the people call themselves Twa and Hutu, so that's
   what they are.

If we look at the southern tip of Africa, a place called "Monomotapa," before the first Europeans came there with the Portuguese in 1486,
 C.E./A.D. (Christian Eera), a man called Captian Bartholomew Diaz, and subsequently another European and his group came, one called Captain
 Vasco da Gama, who came there ten years later in 1496; when they came to that part of Africa they met another group of people there as well,
 which they called "Kaffirs." Now this is a long time before the Boers came there in 1652. When the Boers came those Africans may have gone to
 the moon on vacation (or there they "didn't meet any natives" [Africans] so they say. But one thing is certain, that Bartholomew Diaz and Vasco da Gama
 had already left records showing that when they arrived there at Monomotapa the Khaffirs [Africans], including the small ones (Khoi-Khoi, and Khalaharis)
 (remember I didn't say "Bushmen" or "Hottentots," that's nonsense, the racist names given them by the British and Dutch Boers), were already there.
So with all of these people that were found in this area we could go back at least 35,000 to 40,000 years to another group of people who left their 
writings and their pictures. Those people are called Grimaldi. The Grimaldi were there in the southern tip of Africa, and traveled up the entire western
 coast, then came to the northwestern coast of Africa, and crossed into Spain. Not only in Spain, but all the way up to Austria; it was found that the 
 Grimaldi had traveled and left their drawings in caves all along the way. In the Museum of Natural History, New York City, New York, you can see Grimaldi
 paintings going back to at least 35,000 years ago.
